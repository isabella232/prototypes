# Sample tests for transitions on mobile devices

## Demos
* slide menu similar to facebook mobile but w/ transitions
* content/gallery swiping
* a scrolling demo
    * using native `overflow:scroll` on iOS
    * side by side comparison on android (just using full page height vs a js polyfill using css transforms) 
* only tested on iPhone 4, Nexus one with android 2.2 & 2.3, iPad 2

## PhoneGap
![qr install](https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=116x116&cht=qr&chl=http://build.phonegap.com/apps/277311/install/?qr_key=P7f9pfYpCEHqXsyqvRfx&chld=L|1&choe=UTF-8)

The installer does not work for iOS, because your phone is not in the provisioning profile of the Apple developer certificate used to package it. You need to re-package the app using your own Apple developer certificate.
